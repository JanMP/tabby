## a web-app for guitar and ukulele tabs

I am using Meteor with coffee-script, jade and stylus (to hell with curly brackets).

Very, very, very early development.

Try to run the latest development build [here](http://janmp-tabby.meteor.com) (meteor.com has quite frequent outages lately, so be patient)

under "chords" you can now create and edit tabs.
auto-form still got that bug handling arrays, so it screws up if you
delete any string or finger entry but the last.
