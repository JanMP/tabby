## A web-app for Guitar and Ukulele Tabs

I am using Meteor with coffee-script, jade and stylus (to hell with curly brackets).

This App is still in very early development.

Try to run the latest development build on http://janmp-tabby.meteor.com 

The free service is sometimes a little unstable, so it may or may not work.

##Todo
in no particular order:
* ~~Build responsive display to play along to, with metronome and automated scrolling/page-flipping.~~
* Build output for Printing sheets of tabs.
* ~~Fix the ordering of tabs after tabs have been deleted~~
* Figure an alternative for the instrument picker (sucks on webkit browsers)
* Custom form for Edit Song
* ~~Mouse-Click Editing for tabs~~
* Make User Access to different bits of Data more transparent to the user
* ~~Turn off autopublish~~
* check if subscriptions are ready and display loading-indicators if not
* ~~delete all the tabs when deleting a song~~
* setup Admin Access
